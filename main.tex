\TODO{
    Lay some ground work about why we need this. Make a case for this technology.
    * Satellites
    * Missile Defense - Speed / spectrum tells us about decoys vs actual missles
    * Surveillance
    * Navy / Astronomy - Navigation in low light environments without GPS (Johnson's cover filters) - Talk to apratim/jacob (speed not critical)
    * Include dual use (Non defense) - talk about microscopy, self driving cars, other use cases. Biomedical, neurotransmitters, calcium signaling.

Event-based image sensors (EBISs) offer significant advantages over their frame-based counterparts, including microsecond temporal resolution, high dynamic range, and low power consumption. These sensors, designed to mimic the human eye, produce an event stream that represents instantaneous changes in light intensity, in contrast to traditional frame-based cameras that capture light intensity over a fixed period. Although in its early stages of development, EBIS technology has seen adoption in various industries where temporal and spatial precision is imperative. \TODO{NEED A SOURCE HERE} The unique characteristics of this technology make it an ideal candidate for surveillance applications, satellite monitoring, and tracking environmental changes, just to name a few.

To further enhance the capabilities of EBIS technology for defense applications, we propose integrating it with a novel diffractive filter array developed by researchers at the University of Utah. This filter encodes highly resolved spectral information as a unique spatial pattern called a diffractogram. By combining these technologies, we aim to develop a \TODO{Add something about its temporal resolution} portable real-time, low-power, hyperspectral camera. Such a camera can be taken into the field and provide actionable intelligence in real time.
